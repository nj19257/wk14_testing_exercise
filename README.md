# wk14_testing_exercise

For this exercise some incomplete code "rationals.py" has been given which creates a class for storing a rational number, along with some simple arithmetic functions.

The aim of this exercise is to complete the code so that all the tests are successful.

## Reminders

- Make a virtual environment and then that you can install the pytest module.

    ```
    $ mkdir wk14_testing_example
    $ cd wk14_testing_example
    $ python3 -m venv wk14_testing_example 
    $ source wk14_testing_example/bin/activate
    $ pip instal pytest
    ```

- Read the comments as they will have information about what the function is meant to do.

- Run the tests in the same directory as "rationals.py" by using the command:
    ``` python -m pytest -vv```

- Use the `Rational` class in the python console by importing it using `from rationals import Rational`.
